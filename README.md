## how to work them
For each of the folders download them and go to the base folder and write to the terminal

`npm run start`
or for the developer mode
`npm run dev`


- for NodeJS file see that you have node 12 in use

- for MEAN stack see that you have node 12 and have older angular version in use
    `npm uninstall -g @angular/cli` 
    and then write
    `npm install -g angular-cli`
